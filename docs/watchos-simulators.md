# watchOS Simulators

The same as with iOS simulators, you can run and stop the watchOS simulator directly from the VSCode sidebar. This functionality utilizes `xcrun`, which is a component of the Xcode command-line tools. Check documentation for [iOS Simulators](./simulators.md) for more information.
